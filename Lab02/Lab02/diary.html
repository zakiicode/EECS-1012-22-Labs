<h1> Reading Diary </h1>
<h2> The books I've read recently and my (and Wikipedia's) thoughts about them</h2>

<h2>Winnie-the-Pooh by 	A. A. Milne</h2>
	<p>
		In the Milne books, Pooh is naive and slow-witted, but he is also friendly, thoughtful and steadfast. Although he and his friends agree that he is "a bear of very little brain," Pooh is occasionally acknowledged to have a clever idea, usually driven by common sense.

<h2> The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood</h2>
	<p>
		After a staged attack that killed the President of the United States and most of Congress, a radical political group called the "Sons of Jacob" used quasi-Christian ideology to launch a revolution. The United States Constitution was suspended, newspapers were censored, and what was formerly the United States of America was changed into a military dictatorship known as the Republic of Gilead.
